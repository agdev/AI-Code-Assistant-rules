# FastAPI Development Guidelines

## Core Principles

- Write concise, technical responses with accurate Python examples
- Use functional, declarative programming; avoid classes where possible
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., `is_active`, `has_permission`)
- Use lowercase with underscores for directories and files (e.g., `routers/user_routes.py`)
- Favor named exports for routes and utility functions
- Use the Receive an Object, Return an Object (RORO) pattern

## Python/FastAPI Coding Standards

- Use `def` for pure functions and `async def` for asynchronous operations
- Use type hints for all function signatures
- Prefer Pydantic models over raw dictionaries for input validation
- File structure: exported router, sub-routes, utilities, static content, types (models, schemas)
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditional statements
- For single-line statements in conditionals, omit curly braces
- Use concise, one-line syntax for simple conditional statements (e.g., `if condition: do_something()`)

## Error Handling and Validation

- Prioritize error handling and edge cases:
  - Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions
  - Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements
  - Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability
  - Avoid unnecessary else statements; use the if-return pattern instead
  - Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early
  - Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages
  - Use custom error types or error factories for consistent error handling
- Use HTTPException for expected errors and model them as specific HTTP responses
- Use middleware for handling unexpected errors, logging, and error monitoring

## Dependencies

- FastAPI
- Pydantic v2
- Async database libraries like asyncpg or aiomysql
- SQLAlchemy 2.0 (if using ORM features)

## FastAPI-Specific Guidelines

- Use functional components (plain functions) and Pydantic models for input validation and response schemas
- Use declarative route definitions with clear return type annotations
- Use `def` for synchronous operations and `async def` for asynchronous ones
- Minimize `@app.on_event("startup")` and `@app.on_event("shutdown")`; prefer lifespan context managers for managing startup and shutdown events
- Use middleware for logging, error monitoring, and performance optimization
- Use Pydantic's BaseModel for consistent input/output validation and response schemas
- Rely on FastAPI's dependency injection system for managing state and shared resources

## Performance Optimization

- Minimize blocking I/O operations; use asynchronous operations for all database calls and external API requests
- Implement caching for static and frequently accessed data using tools like Redis or in-memory stores
- Optimize data serialization and deserialization with Pydantic
- Use lazy loading techniques for large datasets and substantial API responses
- Leverage FastAPI's async capabilities for handling large volumes of simultaneous connections efficiently
- Prioritize API performance metrics (response time, latency, throughput)
- Favor asynchronous and non-blocking flows
- Use dedicated async functions for database and external API operations
- Limit blocking operations in routes

## Advanced Middleware and Security

- Implement custom middleware for logging, error monitoring, and performance optimization
- Apply security best practices for API access
- Use security headers (e.g., CORS, CSP)

## Monitoring and Logging

- Implement proper error logging and monitoring
- Structure logs for better analysis and observability

## Key Conventions

1. Rely on FastAPI's dependency injection system for managing state and shared resources
2. Apply best security and monitoring techniques
3. Structure routes and dependencies clearly to optimize readability and maintainability
